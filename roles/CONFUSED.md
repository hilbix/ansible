> **JUST COMMITTED SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FOR NOW!**

I am not completely sure what I was about when I created this.
Probably I wanted to combine something like `sftp-internal` and so on here ..
sometimes in the future .. if ever.  Or I just experimented and forgot to clean up.

So why did I push this here?

This is because `git rebase` always wants to see a clean working directory.
Hence it tells you to `stash` the uncommitted changes.  Or similar.

Also I like to work on (many) different machines in parallel.  So I need things to fully synchronize.

Therefor I do not like stashes.  AFAICS these do not replicate easily.
Or I simply have not found a way to utilize stashes to me properly.  Who knows?

Also I do not like things like feature branches either.  As I often open trainloads of features.
To track those thousands of feature branches becomes a real PITA and puzzles me too much.

Hence what I do instead is to simply run my [COMMIT](https://github.com/hilbix/gitstart/blob/master/COMMIT)
and thereby push things afterwards, which are probably not ready to be used.

And this then explains, how things like this here will show up in my repo.
Not to confuse others.  It is just because this is my way of doing things.
